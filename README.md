## Description

This game was intended to become a 2d platformer metroidvania, similar of that to games such as Hollow Knight, Nine Sols or the original Super Metroid. The game that I have created has a basic but very modifiable movement system, with the features outlined in the "Features" section below. The game follows a lesser young god gaining independence and escaping from it's creators, who are higher, older gods. The game was also intended to have roguelike elements similar to that of Hades
